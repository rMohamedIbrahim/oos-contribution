  <Select>
    <MenuItem>Options</MenuItem>
  </Select>
</FormControl>
```

```jsx
// After: Consistent flexbox alignment
const flexCenterStyles = {
  display: "flex",
  alignItems: "center",
};

<FormControl sx={{ minWidth: "10%", ...flexCenterStyles }}>
  <Select>
    <MenuItem>Options</MenuItem>
  </Select>
</FormControl>;
```
